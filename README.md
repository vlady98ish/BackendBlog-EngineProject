A blog's backend project. Basically, the project involves writing a server program that processes requests correctly from the front end. Java is used in this project. Spring framework is used for web applications based on Rest APIs. Hibernate is used for databases. In addition to MySQL, the project also includes the implementation of relations by type (One-to-One, Many-to-One, and Others).
